# AntiGamingChair
AntiGamingChair is an anti-cheat made by a group of developers (dewgs for example) made for the Minecraft server Minemen Club (minemen.club).

Note that AntiGamingChair is often referred to as "AGC".

## Overview
...

## Checks
AGC has a large variety of checks including:

- Aim Assist

- Auto Clicker

- Fly

- Ping Spoof

- Reach (formerly called Range)

- Velocity

- Inventory

- Hit Boxes

- Kill Aura

### Sub Checks
AGC has their checks organized into sub-checks using letters as a unique identifier.

- Generic Check Name + ID: "Kill Aura Check W"

Depending on the the check, they can have two letters for the identifier.

- Double Letter Name + ID: "Auto Clicker Check AA"

### How Many?
AGC has a TON of different sub-checks, which is why I will try to estimate how much they have (where you dont have to!).

Over the years, some AGC log screenshots have been shared, which will be used for the logic used here.

**Keep in mind that this probably extremely wrong, as I suck at math and do not have the needed information for a good "guess"!**

- For Auto Clicker checks, AGC has an Auto Clicker Check W, which means there are at least 23 checks for Auto Clicker assuming there are NO double-letter ID checks. There are though, so we could guess that they have 30 or more.

- Same apply to Kill Aura checks, AGC has a Kill Aura Check W, meaning there are at least 23 Kill Aura checks.

- Fly has at least 4 sub-checks, since AGC has a Fly Check D.

- Ping Spoof has 1 sub-check, but probably more assuming AGC isn't dogwater.

- Inventory has at least 5 sub-checks, since AGC has an Inventory Check E.

I wont cover the rest, but AGC probably has more than 70 checks. This is probably pretty low for what they actually have, so Ill just bump it up to 100 or more.
